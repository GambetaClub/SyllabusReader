# Syllabus Reader


## Our goal
Our goal is to create an easy way for students to add due dates from the syllabi to their calendars. This would be done by simply adding their syllabus to our program. We would then present the due dates to the student on a calendar and allow them to drag and drop different assignments to allow them to have more freedom and fix any mistakes the program could have. We would also allow for the option of manually adding assignments onto the calendar that the program possibly missed, or something the student would like to add, as well as allowing for the deletion of assignments. In order to achieve accuracy with many different types and styles of syllabi, we will have the user select a certain syllabus format that their syllabus is using. Our plan is to make the calendar our starting interface and from there the user could add an entire syllabus or single assignment. We plan on supporting a PDF file type at the start and adding more file types later if we have time.
